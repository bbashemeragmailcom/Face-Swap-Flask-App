# Face-Swap-Flask-App
In this project, we will be using opencv and dlib to extract faces of human-beings from a given image. We will use a pretrained model to extract landmarks from the faces.

We will be using DLIB for the project and it's landmark's facial detector with pre-trained models, dlib is used to estimate the location of cordinates (x,y) that map the facial points on a person's face.

This project can be used for learning and understanding different concepts of computer vision. This project can be used to build augmented reality applications like snapchat, etc.
